# Happy Birthday

The “Happy Birthday” song is one of the most widely recognized songs in the world, sung to celebrate a person’s birthday. The tune is simple and catchy, with lyrics that are easy to remember, making it a universal anthem for birthday celebrations across cultures and languages. The song’s melody was originally composed in the late 19th century by American sisters Patty and Mildred Hill as part of a greeting called “Good Morning to All.” Over time, the lyrics evolved to celebrate birthdays, and by the 20th century, it became the birthday song known and loved today.
