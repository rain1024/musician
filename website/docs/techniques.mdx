### Harmonizing Melodies with Intervals

Harmonizing melodies using intervals of thirds and sixths adds richness and depth to your playing. By incorporating harmony notes alongside the melody, you create a fuller, more resonant sound that enhances the musical experience.

**Original Melody**

Below is the original melody of *‚ÄúOde to Joy‚Äù* by Ludwig van Beethoven:

```
X:1
T:Ode to Joy - Original Melody
C:Ludwig van Beethoven
M:4/4
L:1/4
Q:1/4=144
K:C
e e f g | g f e d | c c d e | e3/2 d1/2 d2 |
```

#### Harmonization with Sixths

In the following example, the melody is harmonized using intervals of sixths. This means that for each note in the melody, a harmony note is added that is a sixth below. This technique creates a **warm üî•** and **resonant üéµ** sound:

```
X:1
T:Ode to Joy - Harmonized Melody with Sixths
C:Ludwig van Beethoven
M:4/4
L:1/4
Q:1/4=144
K:C
[g,e] [g,e] [a,f] [b,g] | [b,g] [a,f] [g,e] [f,d] | [e,c] [e,c] [f,d] [g,e] | [g,e]3/2 [f,d]1/2 [f,d]2 |
```

**Explanation**

* **Intervals of Sixths**: An interval is the distance between two notes. A sixth spans six letter names (e.g., from E down to G is a sixth).
* **Harmonizing**: By adding a note that is a sixth below the melody note, you create harmony that complements the melody.
* **Application**: In the harmonized example, each pair of notes (e.g., [g,e]) consists of the melody note and its harmony note a sixth below.

**Benefits of Using Sixths**

* **Fuller Sound**: Harmonizing with sixths enriches the musical texture.
* **Expressiveness**: Adds emotional depth to the melody.
* **Variety**: Introduces harmonic variety, enhancing listener engagement.

#### Harmonization with Thirds

In this example, the melody is harmonized using intervals of thirds. This means that for each note in the melody, a harmony note is added that is a third below. This technique creates a **bright ‚ú®** and **uplifting üé∂** sound:

```
X:1
T:Ode to Joy - Harmonized Melody with Thirds
C:Ludwig van Beethoven
M:4/4
L:1/4
Q:1/4=144
K:C
[ce] [ce] [df] [eg] | [eg] [df] [ce] [Bd] | [Ac] [Ac] [Bd] [ce] | [ce]3/2 [Bd]1/2 [Bd]2 |
```

**Explanation**

* **Intervals of Thirds**: An interval of a third spans three letter names (e.g., from C up to E is a third).
* **Harmonizing**: By adding a note that is a third below the melody note, you create harmony that complements the melody.
* **Application**: In the harmonized example, each pair of notes (e.g., [c,e]) consists of the melody note and its harmony note a third below.

**Benefits of Using Thirds**

* **Brighter Sound**: Harmonizing with thirds gives a lighter, more luminous sound.
* **Emotional Impact**: Adds a sense of joy and brightness to the melody.
* **Harmonic Interest**: Introduces new harmonic colors, keeping the music engaging.
