## DAILY PRACTICE

*	**Scales**: Practice major, melodic minor, harmonic minor, and natural minor scales to build dexterity, finger strength, and familiarity with different keys.
*	**Solid Triads**: Work on solid triads to improve cording and inversion skills. Practice one hand at a time before combining both.
*	**Broken Triads**: Play triads one note at a time to maintain hand position and build dexterity for different musical passages.
*	**Arpeggios**: Practice passing the thumb under and keeping the hand relaxed to build strength and dexterity.
*	**Chord Progressions**: Practice common progressions (e.g., 1-4-1-5-1) in different keys to enhance accompaniment skills and ear training.
*	**Ear Training**: Develop ear training by recognizing and singing major and minor chords, bass notes, and melodic patterns.

## MUSIC THEORY

Music theory is the language of music. It provides tools to understand, interpret, and communicate about music. Mastery of music theory enables musicians to generate more ideas, work faster, and seamlessly translate thoughts into music.

## NOTES AND PITCH

* **Sound and Vibration**: Sound is made of vibrations. Faster vibrations are perceived as higher pitches, and slower vibrations as lower pitches.
* **Musical Notes**: Most popular music uses 12 notes. These notes repeat at higher or lower pitches (octaves).
* **Piano Keyboard**: White keys are named A through G. Black keys are named relative to the white keys as sharps (#) or flats (b).

## RHYTHM AND METER

* **Rhythm**: Rhythm is the pattern of sounds and silences in music. It is what makes music move and flow. Rhythm is created by combining different note values (like quarter notes, eighth notes, etc.) and rests (silences).
* **Meter**: Meter is the recurring pattern of beats in music. It is like the heartbeat of a piece of music, giving it structure and flow. Meter is usually indicated at the beginning of a piece by a time signature.

* **Time Signature**: A time signature tells you how the beats are grouped in a piece of music. It is written as a fraction, like 4/4 or 3/4. The top number tells you how many beats are in each measure, and the bottom number tells you what type of note gets one beat.

* **Common Time (4/4)**: This is the most common time signature in Western music. It means there are four beats in each measure, and a quarter note gets one beat.

* **Waltz Time (3/4)**: This time signature means there are three beats in each measure, and a quarter note gets one beat. It gives music a "waltz" feel.

* **Syncopation**: Syncopation is when the regular flow of the rhythm is disrupted by placing emphasis on off-beats or weak beats. It adds excitement and surprise to music.

* **Tempo**: Tempo is the speed at which a piece of music is played. It is usually indicated in beats per minute (BPM). A faster tempo means a quicker pace, while a slower tempo means a more relaxed pace.

Understanding rhythm and meter is essential for musicians as it helps them keep time, stay in sync with other musicians, and bring out the intended feel of the music.

## SCALES AND KEY SIGNATURES

* **Major Scale**: The major scale has a specific pattern: whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step.
* **Key**: A key is a group of notes that sound good together in a piece of music. Major and minor keys are the most common, each typically using seven notes.
* **C Major Scale**: An easy example using only white notes on the piano.

### Major Scale

The Major Scale is one of the fundamental scales in Western music, often considered the backbone of music theory due to its widespread use in various musical genres. 

**Structure of the Major Scale**

The Major Scale consists of seven distinct notes plus an eighth note, which is the same as the first note but an octave higher. The interval pattern for a Major Scale is:

<ScaleTable/>

**Importance of the Major Scale**

* Foundation of Music Theory: The Major Scale serves as a reference point for understanding other scales, modes, and musical concepts.
* Building Chords: Major chords, minor chords, and other chord types are built using notes from the Major Scale.
* Melodic Composition: Many melodies and harmonies in Western music are derived from the Major Scale.

#### C Major Scale

The C Major Scale is the simplest of the Major Scales because it consists of all the natural notes (no sharps or flats). The notes in the C Major Scale are:

*	C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
<img src={Image1} style={{width: 700}} />
</div>

In terms of piano keys, the C Major Scale uses only the white keys:

*	C (root note) - D - E - F - G - A - B - C (octave)

### Minor Scale

## CHORDS

- **Chords**: Multiple notes played simultaneously, crucial for setting the song’s emotion. The most common chords are triads (three notes: root, third, fifth).
- **Major and Minor Chords**: Defined by the interval patterns between notes. Major chords have a happy sound (four semitones then three), while minor chords have a sad sound (three semitones then four).
- **Chord Inversions**: Changing the order of notes in a chord to make transitions smoother and more natural.

## MELODIES

- **Creating Melodies**: Melodies are sequences of single notes played over chord progressions. They often use a mix of chord tones (stable) and passing tones (creating tension).
- **Pentatonic Scale**: A five-note scale that often sounds good over many chord progressions.

## RHYTHM AND COUNTING

- **Musical Timing**: Music is divided into measures with beats. Common time signatures include 4/4, counted as 1-2-3-4.
- **Subdivision**: Dividing beats into smaller parts (e.g., eighth notes, sixteenth notes) to create more complex rhythms.

## PIANO CERTIFICATES

Piano certificates provide structured milestones for musicians to achieve and demonstrate their proficiency at various levels. These certifications help students set goals, receive feedback, and gain recognition for their skills.

* **RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music) Certificate**, The RCM certification program includes practical and comprehensive exams, covering performance and theory from Preparatory levels to Level 10 and ARCT diplomas. This program is globally recognized for its rigorous standards and detailed examiner feedback, motivating continuous improvement and providing academic credits and awards. [﹙❞﹚](https://www.rcmusic.com/learning/examinations)[﹙❞﹚](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyMe-AOb8NU&ab_channel=PianoHouse)
* **ABRSM (Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music) Certificate**, ABRSM offers graded exams from Initial Grade to Grade 8, along with diplomas for advanced musicians.
