## Lyrics & Chords

```
Verse 1:
[B]I used to [E]shut my [G#m]door while my mother [F#]screamed in the kitchen
[B]I'd turn [E]the music [G#m]up, get high and [F#]try not to listen
[B]To every little [E]fight, 'cause [G#m]neither one was [F#]right
 
Pre-Chorus:
[B]I swore I'd never be like [E]them
But [G#m]I was just a kid back [F#]then
 
Chorus:

The older I [E]get the more that I [F#]see
My parents aren't [B]heroes, they're just like [G#m]me
And loving is [E]hard, it don't always [F#]work
You just try your [B]best not to get [G#m]hurt

I used to be [E]mad but now I [F#]know
Sometimes it's [B]better to let [G#m]someone go
It just hadn't [E]hit me yet
The older I [B]get
 
Verse 2:
I used to [E]wonder [G#m]why, why they could [F#]never be happy
[B]I used to [E]close my [G#m]eyes and pray for a [F#]whole 'nother family
Where [B]everything was [E]fine, [G#m]one that felt like [F#]mine
 
(Pre-Chorus)
(Chorus)
(Chorus)

    * This progression creates a sense of stability with the root chord [B] and the familiar sound of [E], followed by the minor [G#m] and dominant [F#]. This progression provides a melodic structure that allows the lyrics to convey introspective and reflective themes.

* Pre-Chorus: [B] - [E] - [G#m] - [F#]
    * Here, the chords repeat, maintaining a sense of continuity and building tension towards the chorus. The repetition of the [B] and [E] chords emphasizes the singer’s reflections on their childhood, while the shift to [G#m] and [F#] adds emotional depth.

* Chorus Chord Progression: [E] - [F#] - [B] - [G#m]
    * The progression shifts to [E] and [F#], which creates a feeling of resolution and openness, before returning to [B] and the melancholic [G#m]. The [E] to [F#] transition helps to elevate the lyrics’ message about understanding and letting go, while [B] and [G#m] bring a sense of introspective resolution.

**Function of Each Chord:**

* B (I chord): Acts as the tonal center of the song, providing stability.
* E (IV chord): Adds a sense of openness and contrast to the [B] chord, creating a more dynamic progression.
* G#m (vi chord): A minor chord that introduces emotional weight, aligning with the introspective nature of the lyrics.
* F# (V chord): A dominant chord that resolves back to [B], providing tension that propels the song forward.

**Emotional Impact:**

The use of these chords helps create a reflective and somber mood, mirroring the theme of self-reflection and coming to terms with the complexities of relationships and family. The shift between major and minor chords allows the listener to feel both the warmth of understanding and the melancholy of letting go.

This progression is a classic example of how chord choices can convey different emotional nuances and enhance storytelling through music.
